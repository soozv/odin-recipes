        <li>1 tsp ground cloves</li>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h4>SERVES 4</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/Gas 7.</li>
        <li>First prepare the marinade by combining all the ingredients with a good grinding of black pepper and a dash of oil. 
            Rub the marinade into the chicken pieces, massaging it into the scored meat. Leave to marinate for at least 1 hour (or, better still, overnight).</li>
        <li>Heat a large ovenproof pan over a medium-high heat and add a dash of oil. Fry the chicken pieces for about 10 minutes until golden brown on all sides. 
            Add the Worcestershire sauce and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover with an ovenproof lid or foil and place in the preheated oven for 20 minutes until cooked through (if your pan isn’t ovenproof, simply transfer the chicken to a roasting tray).
             Remove the foil for the last 5 minutes if the chicken needs colouring a little more.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken hot with rice.</li>
    </ol>
